1. How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a family or given name for the account? Why?
In this lab, there are 41 elements in each C-style character string since the max number is 40 + 1 including 0.

2. Your class declares two member functions named set(...). In C, this would generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
The feature is called "function overloading". It works by different parameters, which the compiler is able to identify the difference of parameters within its functions.
It would understand difference of "set(para1)" and "set(para1, para2)".

I have learned the importance of a class type and how private and public data work in modulator.
